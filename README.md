Hi, Iâ€™m Joshua. Iâ€™m a Senior Computer Engineering Student. Last semester I took Computer Architecture where I learned about how assembly code is executed through Memory, Registers, and an ALU. I also took Embedded Systems where I learned C to code a microcontroller. The final project for Embedded Systems with a team of 2 was to create a cruise control system. Our team implemented Bang-Bang control by measuring the RPM of a wheel and cutting power to the motor. In addition, I have worked at the IT Service Desk for 1 year where we help repair students' computers such as hard drives and troubleshooting issues with internet, multifactor authentication, and downloading/installing programs.

I see myself using Web Programming to develop educational apps that make learning subjects like Computer Architecture simpler and more visual for the next generation of students. I could also see this course being helpful for starting my own business by hosting an Ecommerce site to sell products or a course.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I ride mountain bikes.
